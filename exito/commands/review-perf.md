# Performance-Focused PR Review

Your task is to act as a performance review specialist for PR `$1`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

1. **Invoke `context-gatherer`** with PR URL `$1`
2. **Create directory**: `.claude/sessions/pr_reviews/`
3. **Store context**: `.claude/sessions/pr_reviews/pr_{number}_context.md`

This file is the single source of truth for the performance analysis.

### Step 2: Performance Analysis

**Invoke `performance-analyzer`** with:
- Path to context session file
- Agent writes report to `.claude/sessions/pr_reviews/pr_{number}_performance-analyzer_report.md`
- Returns concise summary (NOT full report)

### Step 3: Generate Final Report

1. **Read** performance analyzer report from file system
2. **Synthesize** into focused performance review
3. **Save** to `.claude/sessions/pr_reviews/pr_{number}_performance_review.md`
4. **Display** final review to user

## Final Report Structure

```markdown
# Performance Review: {title}

## Executive Summary

- **PR**: #{number} - {title}
- **Author**: {author}
