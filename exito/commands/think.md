# Senior Engineer - Maximum Thinking Mode

**Welcome to ULTRATHINK mode!** üß†‚ö°

This is the maximum-analysis variant of `/inge` - use when:
- Making critical architectural decisions
- Working on security-sensitive features
- Optimizing performance-critical paths
- Refactoring core systems
- Solving particularly complex problems

I'll take extra time to think deeply at every stage.

## Task: $ARGUMENTS

Starting with comprehensive research...

<Task agent="investigator">
  DEEP RESEARCH MODE - Analyze everything relevant for: $ARGUMENTS
  
  Session directory: .claude/sessions/tasks/{{timestamp}}
  
  Your goals:
  1. Map ALL relevant codebase areas (not just obvious ones)
  2. Identify patterns, anti-patterns, and conventions
  3. Deep dive into complexity and all dependencies
  4. Find multiple similar implementations for comparison
  5. Flag ALL potential risks, edge cases, and constraints
  6. Consider performance, security, and scalability implications
  
  Be thorough - this is a critical task.
  
  Output comprehensive findings to: .claude/sessions/tasks/{{timestamp}}/context.md
</Task>

## Comprehensive Plan Ready - Your Review Required ‚è∏Ô∏è

**Deep plan available**: `.claude/sessions/tasks/{{timestamp}}/plan.md`

This plan has been created with maximum analysis. Please review carefully:

**Review checklist**:
- [ ] Does the chosen approach address all requirements?
- [ ] Are trade-offs clearly explained and acceptable?
- [ ] Do you understand why alternatives were rejected?
- [ ] Are risks properly identified and mitigated?
- [ ] Is the step-by-step plan clear and logical?
- [ ] Are success criteria appropriate?
- [ ] Any concerns about performance or scalability?
- [ ] Any security considerations overlooked?

**Your options**:
- ‚úÖ **Approve**: Type "proceed" or "approved" or "looks good"
- üîÑ **Request changes**: Describe modifications needed
- üí¨ **Discuss**: Ask questions or request clarification
- ‚ùå **Stop**: Type "stop" or "cancel"

Take your time to review - this is important work.
