# Pixel Perfectionist

**Welcome to the Pixel Command** - Where designs become pixel-perfect reality.

This isn't about "close enough." This is about:

- **Precision** - Every pixel, every spacing, every color exact
- **Visual Excellence** - Designs that look stunning
- **Interaction Delight** - Transitions that feel smooth
- **Responsive Perfection** - Beautiful at every screen size
- **Accessibility** - WCAG compliant, usable by everyone

The workflow:

1. 🔍 **Discover** - Understand design intent and requirements
2. 🎨 **Visual Analysis** - Extract design tokens, components, states
3. 💡 **Envision** - Generate implementation strategies
4. ⚖️ **Feasibility** - Validate approach is achievable
5. 🎯 **Select** - You choose the implementation path
6. 🏗️ **Design** - Component architecture and structure
7. ⏸️ **Approve** - You review and approve the plan
8. 🎭 **Implement** - Pixel-perfect component building
9. 🔄 **Iterate** - Screenshot comparison and refinement
10. 🛡️ **Guard** - Quality and accessibility validation
11. 📝 **Document** - Component documentation

This workflow delivers: **Designs that look exactly as envisioned, work flawlessly, and delight users.**

## Phase 5: Strategy Selection 🎯

**Review strategies and choose your implementation path...**

**Visual Analysis**: `.claude/sessions/pixel/$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID/visual-analysis.md`

**Implementation Strategies**: `.claude/sessions/pixel/$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID/alternatives.md`

**Feasibility Assessment**: `.claude/sessions/pixel/$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID/feasibility.md`

**Please select your preferred strategy**:

- Type your selection (e.g., "Option B" or "B")
- Or combine approaches (e.g., "Option A's component structure + Option B's styling approach")
- Or request modifications
- Or ask questions about responsive behavior, accessibility, or browser support

**Consider**:
- CSS approach (Tailwind, CSS Modules, Styled Components)
- Component architecture (atomic design, feature-based)
- Responsive strategy (mobile-first, desktop-first)
- Animation approach (CSS, JavaScript, Framer Motion)
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG AA, AAA)

## Phase 7: Plan Approval ⏸️

**Implementation plan ready for review**: `.claude/sessions/pixel/$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID/plan.md`

**Review Checklist**:

- [ ] Are all design tokens extracted?
- [ ] Is component hierarchy logical?
- [ ] Are responsive breakpoints defined?
- [ ] Are all interaction states covered?
- [ ] Is accessibility approach sound?
- [ ] Are animation/transition plans appropriate?
- [ ] Is the testing strategy comprehensive?
- [ ] Any concerns or modifications needed?

**What to do next**:

- ✅ **Approve**: Type "proceed", "approved", "go ahead", or "looks good"
- 🔄 **Request changes**: Describe what to modify
- 💬 **Ask questions**: Request clarification on any aspect
- ❌ **Stop**: Type "stop" or "cancel"

## Phase 8: Pixel-Perfect Implementation 🎭

**PIXEL-PERFECT PRINCIPLES ACTIVE**:

- 🎨 Design tokens (all constants extracted)
- 📏 Exact spacing (8px grid system)
- 🎯 Precise colors (hex codes match)
- ✨ All states (default, hover, active, focus, disabled)
- 📱 Mobile-first (responsive at all breakpoints)
- ♿ Accessible (WCAG AA minimum)
- 🎭 Smooth transitions (200-300ms timing)
- 🧪 Component testing (visual + functional)

Implementing with obsessive attention to visual detail...
