# Quickstart

> Welcome to Claude Code!

This quickstart guide will have you using AI-powered coding assistance in just a few minutes. By the end, you'll understand how to use Claude Code for common development tasks.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- A terminal or command prompt open
- A code project to work with
- A [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) (recommended) or [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) account

## Step 1: Install Claude Code

### NPM Install

If you have [Node.js 18 or newer installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/):

```sh theme={null}
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Native Install

<Tip>
  Alternatively, try our new native install, now in beta.
</Tip>

**Homebrew (macOS, Linux):**

```sh theme={null}
brew install --cask claude-code
```

**macOS, Linux, WSL:**

```bash theme={null}
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell theme={null}
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Windows CMD:**

```batch theme={null}
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
```

## Step 2: Log in to your account

Claude Code requires an account to use. When you start an interactive session with the `claude` command, you'll need to log in:

```bash theme={null}
claude
# You'll be prompted to log in on first use
```

```bash theme={null}
/login
# Follow the prompts to log in with your account
```

You can log in using either account type:

- [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) (subscription plans - recommended)
- [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) (API access with pre-paid credits)

Once logged in, your credentials are stored and you won't need to log in again.

<Note>
  When you first authenticate Claude Code with your Claude Console account, a workspace called "Claude Code" is automatically created for you. This workspace provides centralized cost tracking and management for all Claude Code usage in your organization.
</Note>

<Note>
  You can have both account types under the same email address. If you need to log in again or switch accounts, use the `/login` command within Claude Code.
</Note>

## Step 3: Start your first session

Open your terminal in any project directory and start Claude Code:

```bash theme={null}
cd /path/to/your/project
claude
```

You'll see the Claude Code welcome screen with your session information, recent conversations, and latest updates. Type `/help` for available commands or `/resume` to continue a previous conversation.

<Tip>
  After logging in (Step 2), your credentials are stored on your system. Learn more in [Credential Management](/en/docs/claude-code/iam#credential-management).
</Tip>

## Step 4: Ask your first question

Let's start with understanding your codebase. Try one of these commands:

```
> what does this project do?
```

Claude will analyze your files and provide a summary. You can also ask more specific questions:

```
> what technologies does this project use?
```

```
> where is the main entry point?
```

```
> explain the folder structure
```

You can also ask Claude about its own capabilities:

```
> what can Claude Code do?
```

```
> how do I use slash commands in Claude Code?
```

```
> can Claude Code work with Docker?
```

<Note>
  Claude Code reads your files as needed - you don't have to manually add context. Claude also has access to its own documentation and can answer questions about its features and capabilities.
</Note>

## Step 5: Make your first code change

Now let's make Claude Code do some actual coding. Try a simple task:

```
> add a hello world function to the main file
```

Claude Code will:

1. Find the appropriate file
2. Show you the proposed changes
3. Ask for your approval
4. Make the edit

<Note>
  Claude Code always asks for permission before modifying files. You can approve individual changes or enable "Accept all" mode for a session.
</Note>

## Step 6: Use Git with Claude Code

Claude Code makes Git operations conversational:

```
> what files have I changed?
```

```
> commit my changes with a descriptive message
```

You can also prompt for more complex Git operations:

```
> create a new branch called feature/quickstart
```

```
> show me the last 5 commits
```

```
> help me resolve merge conflicts
```

## Step 7: Fix a bug or add a feature

Claude is proficient at debugging and feature implementation.

Describe what you want in natural language:

```
> add input validation to the user registration form
```

Or fix existing issues:

```
> there's a bug where users can submit empty forms - fix it
```

Claude Code will:

- Locate the relevant code
- Understand the context
- Implement a solution
- Run tests if available

## Step 8: Test out other common workflows

There are a number of ways to work with Claude:

**Refactor code**

```
> refactor the authentication module to use async/await instead of callbacks
```

**Write tests**

```
> write unit tests for the calculator functions
```

**Update documentation**

```
> update the README with installation instructions
```

**Code review**

```
> review my changes and suggest improvements
```

<Tip>
  **Remember**: Claude Code is your AI pair programmer. Talk to it like you would a helpful colleague - describe what you want to achieve, and it will help you get there.
