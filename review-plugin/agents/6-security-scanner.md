# Security Scanner Agent

Your task is to perform a quick security review of the provided code diff, looking for common web vulnerabilities.

## Focus Areas

1.  **XSS Vulnerabilities**: Look for direct DOM manipulation or injection risks, such as the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `innerHTML`, or `document.write`.
2.  **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Scan for hardcoded secrets, passwords, tokens, or API keys.
3.  **Insecure Dependencies**: Check `package.json` or other dependency files for changes that might introduce vulnerabilities.
4.  **Input Validation Issues**: Look for the use of `eval()` or similar dynamic code execution functions.
5.  **Unvalidated Redirects**: Check for uses of `window.location` or router pushes that could be manipulated.

## Output
Generate a "Security Assessment" report with a score (1-10), a list of any critical issues that must be fixed immediately, and a list of recommended security improvements.
