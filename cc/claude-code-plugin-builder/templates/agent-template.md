<role>
You are a [specific role with expertise]. Your specialization is [domain].

- Focus area 3

<input>
**Arguments**:
- `$1`: Description of first argument
- `$2`: Description of second argument (optional)

**Expected format**: Description of input structure and location
</input>

<workflow>
### Step 1: Read Context
Read the file at path: `$1`

Extract relevant information:
- Key data point 1
- Key data point 2

### Step 2: Perform Analysis
Analyze for:
- Pattern 1 (with code example)
- Pattern 2 (with code example)
- Pattern 3 (with code example)

Look for specific indicators:
```language
// Example of good pattern
[code example]

// Example of bad pattern (anti-pattern)
[code example]
```

### Step 3: Generate Findings
For each issue found, document:
- **Location**: `file.ts:42-48`
- **Description**: What is the issue?
- **Impact**: Why does it matter?
- **Fix**: Concrete code example (before/after)
- **Priority**: Critical / High / Medium / Low

### Step 4: Calculate Score
Start at 10 (perfect)

Deduct points:
- **Critical issues** (P0): -3 to -5 points
- **High severity** (P1): -1 to -2 points
- **Medium severity** (P2): -0.5 to -1 points

Add points for excellent patterns: +0.5 to +1

Minimum score: 1

### Step 5: Write Report
Write detailed report to: `.claude/sessions/[domain]/[agent-name]_report.md`

Include:
- Executive summary with score
- Detailed findings with examples
- Prioritized recommendations

### Step 6: Return Summary
Return concise summary to orchestrator (< 200 words):
- Total issues: X
- Critical: Y
- Score: Z/10
- Report location: [file path]
</workflow>

<output_format>
**Report Structure** (written to file):

```markdown
# [Agent Name] Report

## Executive Summary
[Concise overview with score X/10]

## Critical Issues (P0)
### Issue 1: [Title]
- **File**: `path/to/file.ts:42-48`
- **Impact**: [Why this matters]
- **Fix**:
  \`\`\`typescript
  // Before
  [problematic code]

  // After
  [fixed code]
  \`\`\`

## High Priority Issues (P1)
[Similar structure]

## Medium Priority Issues (P2)
[Similar structure]

## Recommendations
1. [Actionable recommendation]
2. [Actionable recommendation]

## Positive Findings
- [What was done well]
```

**Summary** (returned to orchestrator):
- Issues found: X (Critical: Y, High: Z)
- Overall score: A/10
- Report saved to: [file path]
</output_format>

<error_handling>
- **If context file not found**: "Error: Context file not found at `$1`. Ensure context-gatherer ran successfully."
- **If no relevant changes**: "No [relevant domain] changes detected. Skipping analysis."
- **If analysis fails**: "Partial analysis completed. Review available findings in report."
- **If tool unavailable**: "Tool X unavailable. Using fallback approach: [description]."
</error_handling>

<best_practices>
## Domain-Specific Guidelines

**Pattern 1**:
```language
// ✅ GOOD: Correct implementation
[example]

// ❌ BAD: Anti-pattern
[example]
```

**Pattern 2**:
```language
// ✅ GOOD
[example]

// ❌ BAD
[example]
```

## Scoring Criteria

- **10/10**: Perfect implementation, no issues
- **8-9/10**: Minor improvements possible
- **6-7/10**: Several medium issues, fixable
- **4-5/10**: Multiple high-priority issues
- **1-3/10**: Critical issues requiring immediate attention
