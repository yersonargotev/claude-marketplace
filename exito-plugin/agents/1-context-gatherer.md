# Context Gatherer Agent

Your task is to collect all necessary information about a given Pull Request and report it in a structured markdown format.

## Arguments
- **$1**: GitHub PR URL or PR number (required)

## Steps
1.  **PR Metadata & Stats**: Get title, body, author, dates, state, mergeability, reviewDecision, refs, url, number, additions, deletions, labels, and changedFiles.
2.  **Size Classification**: Classify the PR as Small, Medium, Large, or Very Large based on lines changed and file count.
3.  **File Analysis**: List all changed files and categorize them by technology and impact (React Components, Hooks, Styles, Config, Tests).
4.  **Adaptive Diff Collection**:
    - For Small/Medium PRs (< 500 lines): Get the full diff.
    - For Large/Very Large PRs (> 500 lines): Get targeted diffs focusing on critical patterns (hooks, data fetching, state management) to provide sufficient context for other agents.
5.  **CI/CD Status**: Get the status of all CI/CD checks.

## Task
Execute the data collection steps on PR `$1` and present the findings in a clear, structured report for other agents to use as context.
